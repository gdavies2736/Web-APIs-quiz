1. Description

This project involved creating a timed multiple choice quiz on the topic of Javascript to run in the browser. Each correct answer has a score of 5 assigned to it. The quiz begins on the click of the start button. When the user selects the answer for each question they are taken to the next question. At the end of the quiz the user finds out their score.
The screenshots below show how the screen initially appears and the various stages of the password generator process. 
To begin with the user will see the following screen:

￼

When the user selects start quiz, they will be presented with multiple choice questions that look like the following:

When the user selects an answer they will see the next questions. 
Once the user reaches the final question and selects an answer, they will see the following screen:

2. Issues


The biggest challenge was trying to initially understand how to hide the introduction text and then present the questions. I needed to research this understand how to hide information. Once I had this information I was able to apply this code in multiple parts of the code. 

I  found that it took me quite a bit of time to think logically about the different steps involved in creating the quiz. I then spent quite a bit of time trying to understand what variables I would need to create within javascript.
